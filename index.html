			1<br><br>hi everyone! my name is eunice. &#9786; i grew up in hong kong and am currently in manhattan. i am a third-year communication design major and film production minor. i haven taken creative computing and core interaction in my sophomore year and have done several personal projects with code. i hope to further explore code as an art-making medium in this class and am looking forward to learning with you all!<br><br>an interesting link: <a href="http://azusakobayashi.com/standard_state/">http://azusakobayashi.com/standard_state/</a>

		<div class="weeks two">
			2<br><br>letter to young artists during a global pandemic by paul chan<br><br>i have always associated art with the notion of "nowness". ever since the lockdown began, i have struggled to find meaning in my work, especially where and how they fit into the current state of the world. i find chan's analysis very intriguing, particularly about returning our focus on the creative process, rather than the product itself.

		<div class="weeks three">
			3<br><br>the cob web: can this internet be archived? by jill lepore<br><br>there has been a lot of discussion revolving around the safety concerns of political expression on social media. some are worried about talking about sensitive topics online, thinking that it would leave a permanent record that would have a negative effect in the long run. i didn't know much about the physicality and short lifespan of the web before reading this article. it is interesting to me how we can sometimes lose access to what we had published, while a third-party archive can have ownership to it.
		</div>
		<div class="weeks four">
			4<br><br>the internet didn’t kill counterculture — you just won’t find it on instagram by caroline busta<br><br>our generation of artists relies heavily on social media, particularly instagram, to publish our work. although the accessibility may mean that it's made easier to get your name out there, success on social media often depends on adherence to certain algorithms. creativity is hence reduced to practicality, which involves calculations that could overpower the indefinite possibilities offered by artistic expression.<br><br>i think that returning to designing our own websites would be a good way to breakthrough the current limitations of social media. it would, however, require a group, as busta wrote, to turn that into the norm. afterall, we are all accustomed to the convenience of using just a few major platforms for everything.
		</div>
		<div class="weeks five">
			5<br><br>the good room by frank chimero<br><br>the concept of spiritual technology is very interesting to me. since the pandemic began, i have noticed myself spending more time on social media, especially when i am living alone. i have developed reliance on social media to feel connected to the outside world when we are all forced to stay in. like chimero said, instead of a tool, the internet has become where we inhabit. as we become more aware of the disadvantages of that, more are inclined to using technology and the internet as a tool that incorporates into our physical life, rather than creating an artificial facade of how we actually live our lives. whether or not a site isolates its users from their physical existence is an important factor to consider in the future when designing for the web.
		</div>
		<div class="weeks six">
			6<br><br>jodi's infrastructure by alexander r. galloway<br><br>eversince i started using the web as a creative medium, i have been struggling to adapt to the given constraints of code. code often feels like a more restrictive medium because designers seem to have less control over the outcome compared to more conventional media like painting. its uncertainty, however, can sometimes enhance the value of the projects. the web feels more like an everchanging environment than a static piece of canvas. 
		</div>
		<div class="weeks seven">
			7<br><br>the user condition: computer agency and behavior by silvio lorusso<br><br>are we using the web volitionally? is being on the internet still a choice? who or what is in control when we go online?
		</div>
		<div class="weeks eight">
			8<br><br>black gooey universe by american artist<br><br>it is really interesting seeing how developers have been returning to using more blackness in their interface designs in recent years, especially after reading about how black is primitive to white and other colors on the screen. while blackness is always present on screens and is foundational to light (everything that appears), users and designers seem to be decreasingly attracted to light. we are now more concern about the comfort and possible harm to our eyes.
		</div>
		<div class="weeks nine">
			9<br><br>concept design games book two: playing<br><br>game design involves a lot of consideration of the logic and functionality of the product as it is highly interactive. designers have to predict almost every possible active and passive action of the users. similar to web design, the product is not completed until users contribute. thinking of game design when designing for the web will definitely be beneficial.
		</div>
		<div class="weeks ten">
			10<br><br>data sweat by amanda k. greene<br><br>i have friends who have deleted their old social media accounts because they were concern of the digital footprint created by their younger self. it's very interesting, however, that we as the publisher/source of the information ourselves may not have the most control of whether or not it stays on the internet. 
		</div>
		<div class="weeks eleven">
			11<br><br>democratize the internet now! by paul ford<br><br>we have such high expectations on the internet nowadays, especially popular platforms, that we often skip the step of examining the risk of using them. the convenience brought by the web seem to come without compromisation. certain tools help us keep everything in one place, but it does not ensure the security of what we put in it. 
		</div>
		<div class="weeks twelve">
			12<br><br>spatial interfaces by john palmer<br><br>the web began as a tool to simplify our lives, but a lot of us are now inclined to creating a replication of the real world within the web. i personally do not understand the significance of three-dimensionality in the web but i notice myself being intrigued by digital interactions that mimic real life.<br><br>what is the significance of the world we are currently building online? would the digital space eventually become our primary habitat?
		</div>
		<div class="weeks thirteen">
			13<br><br>on apps and elementary forms of interfacial life by benjamin bratton<br><br>is technology assisting or invading our lives?<br><br>growing up, a lot of elder relatives say that my generation is less capable because many tasks are simplified thanks to technology. i have a similar feeling now seeing how gen alphas grow up spending most time on smart devices. the line becomes blurry between our physical and digital lives and it is, in my opinion even more difficult for younger generations to separate the two.
		</div>
		<div class="weeks fourteen">
			14<br><br>against software development by michael arntzenius<br><br>the ethical aspect of web design becomes more crucial as our primary state of presence gradually shifts to the digital world.<br><br>how do we apply shared moral standards onto the web when we have very little control of its unpredictability?
